# 🏨 Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes hotel booking cancellations to identify trends and key influencing factors. Using Microsoft Excel, we perform in-depth data analysis through **Pivot Tables**, **Power Query**, and **Conditional Formatting**. The dataset includes bookings from both **City** and **Resort Hotels**, covering guest types, booking statuses, room preferences, and monthly arrival data.
